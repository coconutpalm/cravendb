;; What I'd probably do is keep documents in memory once written
;; because they'd need to be hit by both indexing and replication
;;
;; What I also probably want to do is keep a list of etags/ids written
;; and generate the stream information from that rather than hitting the database
;; ideally, consuming the stream shouldn't involve disk IO
;; We can probably even push the stream as an edn stream using edn/read-string

;; Master -> Slave Happenings (easy)
;; NOTE: We're not taking into account indexing as part of this if we bypass database
;; Maybe indexing needs to be reading off a queue
;; Or maybe indexing needs to have a queue as an extra

;; On starting up the second server, we should see the documents that were written to the first
;; They should have the same etags as the first
;; They will anyway because it's a slave so it's "magic"

#_ (first (c/stream-seq "http://localhost:8081"))
#_ (first (c/stream-seq "http://localhost:8080"))

;; On adding documents to the first server, they should appear on the second
;; They should have the same etags as the first

#_ (c/put-document "http://localhost:8080" "new-doc" { :hello "world"})
#_ (c/get-document "http://localhost:8080" "new-doc")
#_ (c/get-document "http://localhost:8081" "new-doc")

;; They should have updated etags the same as the first

#_ (c/put-document "http://localhost:8080" "great-doc" { :hello "bill"})

;; The slave stores where it is currently caught up to in storage somewhere
;; It also stores the number of documents it has received from each node
;; This will be useful for testing and feedback

#_ (replication-status (:storage destinstance) "http://localhost:8080")

;; If I shut down the slave, it should continue from where it left off

;; If I shut down the master, the slave should gracefully await instruction

;; If I delete a document in master, it should be deleted in slave

;; Master -> Master Happenings (Currently impossible)
;; Will ignore this until we have tests for master -> slave in place

;; On writing a document to the first server, it should appear in the second
;; It should not be replicated back to the other server (how?)
;; We could just provide the list in ordered e-tag terms, and we can do a look-up
;; And prevent replication

;; What happens when writing 
;; doc-1 -> a1 -> b1
;; doc-1 -> b2 -> a2
;; We should know that a2 is a descendent of a1
;; We can do that by using vector-clocks
;; We could also achieve it by storing an audit history (this would get expensive)
