- We have the following constructs thus far

  - Storage = Transactional key/value storage and iteration over that key value storage
  - Documents = Functions over the top of storage for storing documents/etags
  - Indexes - Functions over the top of Documents for storing indexes

  - Indexing - Functions that interpret those indexes
  
  - IndexStorage

      - for lack of a better name, this is where the state of indexes ends up
      - Every time a new index is added, this needs to load that index
      - Every time an index is modified, this needs to re-load that index
      - Every time an index is removed, this needs to drop that index

      - This needs to watch for changes to documents and plough them into the storage

      - This needs to be modelled as a separate process effectively
