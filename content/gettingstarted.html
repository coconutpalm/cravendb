# Getting started

There are a few ways we can use Craven, in order of increasing complexity

- As an in-process embedded database
- As a remote single node http server
- As a remote cluster of http nodes

This little getting started guide will focus on the first one, so we can get to grips with "how Craven works", the client API for the above scenarios are the same apart from the set-up.

### Getting it into your project

I'll have it in a maven thingy, honest

### Creating a connection object

No matter how we use Craven, we need to create a handle to the database. This is designed to be used across the whole application for performing calls to the client (so created on application start-up, and thrown away on application tear-down).

```clojure
(require 'cravendb.database :as database)
```
