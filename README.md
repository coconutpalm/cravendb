# CravenDB

- A document database written in Clojure *for* Clojure
- It was originally based on RavenDB's design
- A rough to-do can be found in the file [todo.markdown](https://github.com/robashton/cravendb/blob/master/todo.markdown)
- So far we have
 - dynamic full-text queries against stored documents
 - custom indexes for advanced queries against stored documents
 - multi-document operations (transactional writes)
 - multi-master replication using vclocks for lineage checks
 - conflict-based concurrency control (when *strictly* necessary)
 - embedded database for local development
 - in-memory mode for fast testing
 - http server(s) for production
