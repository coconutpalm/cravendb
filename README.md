# CravenDB

- An attempt at a RavenDB look-a-like written in Clojure
- It is diverging from Raven's design
- It is not going to be completed probably
- It is not going to be written for actual use
- It is just exploring the notion of doing something tangible in Clojure
- See todo.markdown for a rough indication of progress vs debt


# Instructions

- Use the repl to explore
- Use the tests to verify (lein specs)
- Run the http server with 'lein run'
