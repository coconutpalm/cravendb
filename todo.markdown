# Implemented thus far

- Transactional key-value storage on top of LevelDB
- Document storage on top of that
- Index storage on top of documents
- Etags per documents kept per version
- Wrapper around Lucene for index content
- Indexing process that executes 'maps' documents into Lucene
- Querying against the indexes, loading documents that match
- HTTP API around the above
- Basic client API around the HTTP API
- Bulk imports
- A rudimentary client-side session helper
- Paging through query results
- Mapping happens in chunks so safe-shutdown can be had during repl tests
- Dynamic queries (no creation of index required!)
- A temporary query language against documents
- synctag generation is incremental and thread-safe for a single node
- vector clocks used to track document history and do cross-node conflict avoidance
- MVCC with manual conflict resolution
- Travis CI set-up

# TODO

### Immediate issues

- Look at schemas to help with indexing (joins/aggregations)
- Failed tasks
- Use quickcheck or whatever to validate query support 
- Use quickcheck or whatever to validate replication and storage
- PROFILE PROFILE PROFILE PROFILE PROFILE
- Allow streaming of queries to the very end
- I think the way I currently write synctags mean we could
  - Skip the indexing of documents during high write scenarios
  - Skip the replication of documents during high write scenarios
  - The former I can fix by constantly updating a 'lowest indexed synctag'
  - The latter .... Perhaps explicit support in the streaming endpoints
    - That will mean registering a subscription and keeping a lowest streamed synctag around
    - How do I clean subscriptions up? (I don't? Can stick in actual storage? Caching though? Sounds complected)


### Pending tasks

- Client should be handling HTTP results properly
- Automatic peer discovery
- Use long-polling for replication/streaming
 - can probably do this with events from database
 - can then use this for pushing indexing tasks too

### Pending debt/questions/bugs

- How best to deal with conflicts in a multi-master scenario? At the moment we remain inconsistent across the cluster
- Can I use leveldb's write/read options to do my work for me?
- I need to show sensible parsing errors on parsing failure
- Consider all those small functions as inline functions
- Allow indexes to be provided as actual functions (sfn macro) - this will make testing easier
- Look at threading indexing
- Try to use the Clojure string library rather than all the .startsWith etc
- Look at using reducers to queue up the indexing operation (currently creating new sequences per transformation)
- Handle indexes that can't be compiled for some reason
- Indexes should ideally be defended from concurrency too

### To look at 

- Jig (repl restart helpers)
- Route One - generating URLs
- clj-http library 
- Use clout
- See if slingshot is deprecated or not
- Ribol - Have a gander, but only a gander
- Might want to use Quartz for scheduling things in the future (there's a joke there somewhere)
